  <span class="ma0 montserrat">“Sometimes I get emotional over fonts.” - Kanye West</span>

  I love to create things that matter. The greatest satisfaction I get in my work comes from designing meaningful end-to-end experiences. I thrive in fast-paced environments, especially those in the interactive digital field.

  Design has always been a part of my life. You could say it started when I drew my favorite animated characters as a kid, or when I taught myself to design and code my first Xanga theme, or when I fell in love with my AP Studio Art course in high school. My natural curiosity pushes me to many different creative mediums while continuing to build on my existing skills.

  I am a product designer with seven years of experience designing in financial, government tech media, e-commerce, and software development industries. My portfolio includes touchscreen vending and point-of-sale technology, dashboards and applications, websites, print, and environmental design. I have a Bachelor of Fine Arts from The Art Institute of Washington, and a User Experience Research certificate from General Assembly. In my spare time, I volunteer as a TA and designer at 826CHI in Wicker Park.

  Other creative outlets include hand-lettering, painting, digital and film photography, and more recently, animation. I love traveling, I laugh a lot (and loudly), I spend too much time analyzing Mad Men and Twin Peaks, and I really, really enjoy both cooking and eating food.
