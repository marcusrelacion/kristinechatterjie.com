solution-header: Solution
solution-text: 'This project was split between myself and another designer on my team.
  Since I have a bit of experience with animation, I was tasked to work on the design
  for the mobile pages as well as simple animations in the headers and footers, while
  she was in charge of the desktop and tablet designs.

'
process-header: Process
process-text: 'We started with a kickoff meeting with the project stakeholders, talking
  through all the different aspects of content needed in each of the pages. As this
  project was very content heavy, the solution had to make it easy for readers to
  search through and find the information they were looking for. Facebook provided
  us with illustrations to integrate throughout the layout which helped breakup our
  designs and avoid pages from appearing too content-heavy. After the the main parts
  of the mobile designs were completed, I started working simultaneously on the header
  and footer animations. Since these were to be subtle motions meant to provide a
  fun and playful tone in otherwise serious content, I focused on creating slight
  movements that looped. The end result for this project were Zeplin files passed
  over to our in-house developer for the pages, and gifs for the headers and footers.
