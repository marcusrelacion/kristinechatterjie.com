problem-text: 'The Reorder Products page in the account section of Walgreens.com is
  an underutilized feature that was launched without going through a proper research
  and design process. There is very little-to-no awareness of this feature, and from
  a business perspective can be an effective tool for repeat purchases.

solution-header: Solution
solution-text: 'Buy Again (formerly Reorder Products) is a product that was created
  to allow customers to browse through products they have previously purchased online
  and in-stores. This iteration of the product was designed to provide an easily digestible
  browse page to help customers find the products they’re looking for, know what savings
  and deals are associated with those products, and personalize their data to show
  them their most frequently purchased items first.

process-text: 'My initial research involved different types of shopping lists from
  a variety of online retailers. This research included sketching wireframes and determining
  which features paired well with the Walgreens brand and project goals. I worked
  closely with the UX designer on my team to determine what information would be useful
  to show on the product cards, and identify what other areas of the site this product
  would affect. Based on the nature of our product grids, I designed comps with a
  list view to differentiate personalized lists from general product lists on Walgreens.com.
  My comps included designs for desktop, tablet, and mobile, showing the different
  breakpoints of each device size. Through this process I also worked closely with
  the copywriter on my team to ensure that the tone and experience of the user flow
  matched our project goals.
