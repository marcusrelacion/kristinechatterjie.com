  After determining a problem to solve, I began with competitor and market research which helped me form four different personas for Show It. I created a user flow by determining what would be featured in a minimum viable product. From there I worked on wireframes for the application, and established what screens would be necessary for the features that would be included. After designing the app and creating an InVision prototype, I was able to user test 14 different people to get feedback on all aspects from branding, to usability, to features, and overall design. As the main purpose for this project was to go through all the phases of user experience research, the final product was the prototype and case study. My case study for Show It is featured in General Assemblyâ€™s User Experience Design Gallery, and can also be viewed here.
