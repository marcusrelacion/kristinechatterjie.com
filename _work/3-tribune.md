problem-header: Problem
problem-text: 'There is a lot of social media interaction with local news articles,
  but as a result their home pages are losing traffic. Additionally, there are noticeable
  drops in traffic and share rates during weekends. Tribune Media wanted to experiment
  with a different approach to their layout to track the impact it would have with
  engagement on their site.

project-goal-header: Project Goal
project-goal-text: "To get users to return to the site more often while lowering the
  bounce rates, establishing the news brand, and incorporating ad space. \n"
solution-header: Solution
solution-text: 'Redesigning the local news site would help strengthen the brand and
  create an easier social media integration that keeps readers on the site longer.
  On a site that creates 20-40 new pieces of content a day, readers want to know that
  they can trust this news source, and that by coming to its home page they’ll be
  able to find the type of news they’re looking for quickly and with ease.

'
process-header: Process
process-text: 'The process began with researching trends in media and news sites.
  From there we created three personas based on the user and business goals. Using
  the three personas, we were able to make decisions on how articles were presented
  and come up with a different approach to the content-heavy menu bar. Some of the
  features that were added to the site included an article progress bar, accent colors
  for each of the different sections of news, and reference comps for last noted feature
  to promote continuous reading and social media sharing. The deliverables for this
  project included the details of our personas, wireframes, design comps, and an InVision
  prototype. After the design portion was complete, we worked closely with our in-house
  developer to build the site.
