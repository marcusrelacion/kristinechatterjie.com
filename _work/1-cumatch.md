problem-header: Problem
problem-text: "CUCollaborate wanted to launch a web survey to help potential clients
  find credit unions that they’re eligible to join. CUCollaborate had their own internal
  developer, but needed a designer to think through the user experience and flow,
  in order to provide the best product for credit unions and their customers.  \n"
project-goal-header: Project Goal
project-goal-text: 'Create a web survey that takes users through the appropriate question
  flow to find the credit unions that best fit their needs. On the business end, this
  survey needed to be created as a white-label product, so invested credit unions
  would be able to use this service and change it to match their brands.

'
solution-header: Solution
solution-text: 'This project had a “choose your own adventure” theme, and it allowed
  users to answer as few as three questions to find a result. In order to make the
  survey seem less daunting, I display a progress bar through the initial three questions,
  which are required for a result, as well as a questionnaire menu that allows the
  user to answer questions in any order they choose.

'
process-header: Process
process-text: 'This project started with research in the credit union industry, as
  well as different styles of web surveys that exist today. We finalized the “choose
  your own adventure theme” in a rapid ideation session, which led to whiteboarding,
  wireframing, and finally visual design. There was a lot of time spent determining
  the best user flow to make this process work seamlessly and provide an experience
  that was self-guided. I created illustrations to add subtle visual cues and make
  add a bit of life to the interactions in the survey. The CSS prototype I handed
  off to the CUCollaborate developer was build with a web design tool called WebFlow.
  Because of the interactions and transition animations in the prototype, I also had
  to solve an issue in Javascript before passing off the files to the developer. The
  survey can be found at [http://creditunionmatch.com](http://creditunionmatch.com
  "http://creditunionmatch.com").
