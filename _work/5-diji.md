problem-text: 'After having the same product grid design on their machines for many
  years, Diji Touch was looking for a fresh redesign to entice more customers to use
  their machines. The interface was outdated and designed to imitate traditional vending
  machine layouts.

solution-header: Solution
solution-text: 'The main approach for this project was to take advantage of the technology
  in a touch screen vending machine. The original layout was designed to mimic a traditional
  vending machine which impedes the full potential of a touch screen device. One of
  the limitations that we needed to work around was the requirement to display all
  products in the machine at once, which could potentially be around 50 products in
  one machine at a time. Since this meant common touch screen interactions were  not
  viable options, the first focus became the typography. Along with adding a quick-add
  feature, a filter option was also added as a way to quickly scan products on the
  grid. Other areas of the interface that were redesigned include the layout of the
  menu, the footer, the product detail layout, and the cart and vending screens.

process-header: Process
process-text: "Initial research for this project began with finding touch screen machines
  to interact with e.g. Redbox. Although the team had access to our own Diji Touch
  machine in the office, exploring other machines provided insight to concerns such
  as ADA accessibility and touch screen interactions that were already being used
  in the field. One of the many benefits of having access to a Diji Touch machine
  in the office was the ability to periodically conduct user testing as screens and
  designs were updated. The results pulled from these sessions influenced decisions
  made in the design and user flow of the machine. As the original layout was designed
  to mimic a traditional vending machine which impedes the full potential of a touch
  screen device. \n\nOne of the limitations that we needed to work around was the

  portion was completed, I created an extensive InVision prototype (around 100 screens)
  to create a prototype for clients that required a seamless experience in order to
  approve the designs. Once everything was approved, I worked closely with our in-house
  developers to bring the new interface to life.\n"
