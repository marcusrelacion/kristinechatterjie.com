bio-text: |
  I'm an East Coaster living in Chicago with my plump cat Ava. I have a Bachelor of Fine Arts, and have experience in UI/UX, print, web, and environmental design. Other creative outlets include hand-lettering, painting, digital and film photography, and more recently animation.
  
  I laugh a lot (and loudly), spend too many hours talking about music/books/shows/movies, and I really, really enjoy food.
